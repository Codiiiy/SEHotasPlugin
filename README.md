Joystick & HOTAS Support Plugin

KEEEEN!!! Joystick and HOTAS support has been long overdueâ€”so hereâ€™s my plugin to finally add it.

Iâ€™ve tested this on Keenâ€™s official servers without any issues. Keep in mind, though, that some public servers may have their own restrictions or rules that could block plugins.

âœ¨ Features

Full bindable controls for joysticks and HOTAS devices.

Sensitivity and deadzone adjustments per axis.

Two reverse options:

Assign an axis as reverse thrust.

Simple toggle to reverse forward thrust.

ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide
