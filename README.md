# Joystick & HOTAS Support Plugin  

**KEEEEN!!!** Joystick and HOTAS support has been long overdue—so here’s my plugin to finally add it.  

I’ve tested this on Keen’s official servers without any issues. Keep in mind, though, that some public servers may have their own restrictions or rules that could block plugins.
