KEEEEN!!! Joysticks Hotas support would be amazing, So heres my plugin to add it. 

THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER AS I PLAY SOLO.

Known Issues:

-Firing Sounds sometimes dont play

-Only devices catorgized as game controllers are detected.

Things I plan on adding
-a menu to add devices not catorgized as game controllers so generic device can work.

-a toggle to change gameactions from button to switch (so devices with switchs that stay on work better)

-Save and load profile buttons so users can share profiles

-Binding specific sensitivity and curves

Any bug reports are greatly appreciated.
