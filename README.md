KEEEEN!!! Joysticks Hotas support would be amazing, So heres my plugin to add it. 
THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER AS I PLAY SOLO.

Known Issues:
-Firing Sounds sometimes dont play
-Only devices catorgized as game controllers are detected.

Things I plan on adding
-Add a menu to add devices not catorgized as game controllers so generic device can work.
-add a toggle to change gameactions from button to switch (so devices with switchs that stay on work better)

Any bug reports are greatly appreciated.
